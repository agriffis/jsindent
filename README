This is a Javascript indenter built on Ned Batchelder's jslex. It works
presently in Vim; just put javascript.vim and vimjsindent.py in
~/.vim/indent and it should work immediately.

Most things work as you'd expect, and there's even support for simple
conditions without braces, but there isn't true support for automatic
semicolon insertion yet. That's coming in the refactor branch, where I'm
working on generalizing the indenter and adding tests as well.
